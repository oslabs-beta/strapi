## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:

- Make sure your server is up and running on your machine. If you are in development, the server URL should be something like `http://localhost:1234`, with the 1-2-3-4 being your server's port number.
- If your application is running in a Docker container, make sure to have your local port exposed and ensure you are referencing the right port number.

### Instructions:

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure your server's API endpoints are exposed and your server is running.
3. Within the StrAPI directory, run `npm run dev`
4. Click the "Dashboard" link located on the header at the top-right of the page.
5. Input all required testing parameters as shown on the Dashboard page.
6. After all required parameters are input, hit "Start Test" to begin the test.
